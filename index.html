		<p>As you can see, Charizard is both objectively and subjectively better than the fat turtle!<br/> But in case you still have doubts (LOOKING AT YOU DAVID) this was settled in the Canon:</p>

		<h3>Webpage Comparison</h3>
		<p> There's another <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/92159380-pokemon-facts-charizard">Charizard page here</a>. It's impressive that they have a comments section which posts directly onto the webpage. Plus, the links to other articles on the site come with images related to the content, which are nicely positioned to the side of the link. The social media links disappear once you scroll down far enough. The drop down menu on top with various navigation links is well done as well. The aesthetics of the spacing on the page strike me as a little off, but overall the site is well executed. Reading through the site source is somewhat overwhelming just from the sheer volume of it. Many elements are familiar, but there are certainly new ones as well. It also looks like they're incorporating javascript somehow in the middle of the coding??? There's a long coding path ahead of me for sure.</p>
